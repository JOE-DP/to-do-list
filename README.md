## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** EJS, CSS, JavaScript, Node JS, Mongo DB

This was built using EJS, CSS, JavaScript, Node JS, Mongo DB. 

## Optimizations

To optimise this product further I would create an authentication system to allow users to have a personal list.

I had trouble uploading to Heroku, and to solve the problem I needed to change the permissions on Mongo DB to ensure that the correct IP addresses had access to the database.
